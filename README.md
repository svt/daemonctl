# Daemon Control (daemonctl)

**Description**:  A python framework and tools to manage small applications

**Technology stack**: Plain python
**Status**:  Running in production [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
When administrating alot of applications on different servers or
developing alot of small services it's often desireable to keep
the inhouse services seperate from system services.

## Dependencies

- python >= 2.6
- setprocname: to have cleaner names in ps for the daemons (not required)
- fast-entry_points

## Installation

sudo ./setup.py install

## Configuration

configfile in `/usr/local/etc/daemonctl.conf` (or where DAEMONCTL is installed)

Configformat:

```
   logpath = logdir # Path to directory where log files will be placed
   pidpath = piddir # Path to directory where pid files will be placed
   modules {
    module1 {
     name = modulename # name of daemon in status and
                         other daemonctl commands (should include %(id)s if type=dynamic)
     type = moduletype # single or dynamic
     path = modulepath # Path to where the files are
                         (will do chdir to here before running command)
     execcmd = commandline # Command to run (will be prefixed with path)
     listcmd = listcommand # Command that returns id:s for
                             type=dynamic, one id per row
     logpath = logdir # Can override the global logpath
     pidpath = piddir # Can override the global pidpath
     runas = username # Run daemon as this user
    }
   }
```
